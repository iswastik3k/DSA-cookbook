# Solution: Remove Nth Node from End of List (Leetcode 19)

### ðŸ§  Algorithm Used: Two-Pointer Technique with Dummy Node

We use two pointers, **fast** and **slow**, initialized at a dummy node before the head:

- Advance the **fast** pointer `n + 1` steps ahead.
- Move both pointers until `fast` reaches the end.
- The **slow** pointer will be right before the node to delete.
- Remove the target node by adjusting pointers.

This approach handles edge cases cleanly (e.g., removing the head).

### ðŸ§ª Edge Cases

- Removing the first node (head) of the list.
- Single-element list.
- List length equals `n`.

### ðŸ“ˆ Complexity

- Time: O(N), with N as list length.
- Space: O(1).

### ðŸ§¾ Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        // Create a dummy node that points to head
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy->next = head;

        ListNode* fast = dummy;
        ListNode* slow = dummy;

        // Move fast pointer n+1 steps ahead
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
            fast = fast->next;
        }

        // Move both pointers until fast reaches the end
        while (fast != nullptr) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
        }

        // Delete the nth node from the end
        ListNode* nodeToDelete = slow->next;
        slow->next = slow->next->next;
        delete nodeToDelete;

        // Return the new head
        ListNode* newHead = dummy->next;
        delete dummy;
        return newHead;
    }
};
```

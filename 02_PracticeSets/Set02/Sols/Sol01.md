# Solution: Delete Node in a Linked List (Leetcode 237)

### ðŸ§  Algorithm Used: Value Overwrite + Pointer Bypass

In this problem, you're given access only to the node to be deletedâ€”not the head of the list.  
To "delete" it:

- Copy the value of the next node into the current node.
- Redirect the current nodeâ€™s `next` pointer to skip the next node.

This effectively removes the next node, making the current node behave like it was deleted.

### ðŸ§ª Edge Cases

- Node is the last in the list â†’ not allowed by problem constraints.
- Node is part of a two-element list â†’ still works.
- Multiple deletions not supported â†’ single operation only.

### ðŸ“ˆ Complexity

- Time: O(1)
- Space: O(1)

### ðŸ§¾ Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
        // Copy the next node's value into this node
        node->val = node->next->val;

        // Bypass the next node to effectively delete it
        node->next = node->next->next;
    }
};
```

# ðŸ”— SET - 02: Linked Lists

### Pre-Requisites:

- Understanding of pointers and memory references
- Familiarity with struct/class-based node definitions
- Basic recursion and iteration techniques

### What you'll learn in this set:

- Fast-slow pointer techniques (cycle detection, middle finding)
- Recursive and iterative reversal patterns
- Merge, split, and sort operations on linked lists
- Deep dive into pointer re-routing and memory hygiene
